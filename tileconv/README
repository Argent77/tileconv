TILECONV
~~~~~~~~

Version: 0.3
Author:  Argent77

This tool allows you to compress or decompress TIS and MOS files provided by 
Infinity Engine games such as Baldur's Gate or Icewind Dale.
The tool uses modern compression algorithms to achieve great compression ratios 
without noticeable degradation in quality.

Supported conversions:
* TIS files will be automatically compressed into the TBC format.
* TBC files will be automatically decompressed into the TIS format.
* MOS files will be automatically compressed into the MBC format.
* MBC files will be automatically decompressed into the MOS format.

A detailed description of the TBC and MBC formats can be found in FORMATS.


USAGE
~~~~~

Usage: tileconv [options] infile [infile2 [...]]

Options:
  -e          Do not halt on errors.
  -s          Be silent.
  -v          Be verbose.
  -t type     Select pixel encoding type.
              Supported types:
                0: No pixel encoding
                1: BC1/DXT1 (Default)
                2: BC2/DXT3
                3: BC3/DXT5
  -u          Do not apply tile compression.
  -o output   Select output file or folder.
              (Note: Output file works only with single input file!)
  -z          MOS only: Decompress MBC into compressed MOS (MOSC).
  -q level    Specify quality vs. speed ratio. Supported levels: 0..9
              (Defaults: 9 for encoding and 4 for decoding)
              Applied level-dependent features
                for encoding TIS/MOS to TBC/MBC:
                  Iterative cluster fit:   levels 7 to 9
                  Single cluster fit:      levels 3 to 6
                  Range fit:               levels 0 to 2
                  Weight color by alpha:   levels 5 to 9
                for decoding TBC/MBC to TIS/MOS:
                  Dithering:               levels 5 to 9
                  Posterization:           levels 0 to 2
                  Additional techniques:   levels 4 to 9
  -j num      Number of parallel jobs to speed up the conversion process.
              Valid numbers: 0 (autodetect), 1..256 (Default: 0)
  -T          Assume undetected input files as headerless TIS (use with care!)
  -I          Show file information and exit.
  -V          Print version number and exit.

Supported input file types: TIS, MOS, TBC, MBC
Note: You can mix and match input files of each supported type.

BUILDING TILECONV
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dependencies:
- zlib (http://www.zlib.net/)
- pngquant (https://github.com/pornel/pngquant/)
- libsquish (https://code.google.com/p/libsquish/)

External libraries and include files are assumed to be located in the 
subfolders "zlib", "squish" and "pngquant". The libraries are providing their 
own instructions how to compile them. Afterwards call "make" to build tileconv.
Note: You'll need a compiler that supports the C++11 standard.

If you want to change paths for the external libraries or include files, 
you can do so by modifying the file "config.mk" by hand.
